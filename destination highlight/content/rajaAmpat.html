      <p>
        Far from the view-blocking skyscrapers, dense and hectic concrete jungles, congested traffics,
        flickering electric billboards, endless annoying noises, and all the nuisances of modern 
        cities, you will find a pristine paradise where Mother Nature and warm friendly people 
        welcome you with all the exceptional wonders in <b>Raja Ampat</b>, the islands-regency in West 
        Papua Province. With all the spectacular wonders above and beyond its waters, as well as 
        on land and amidst the thick jungles, this is truly the place where words such as beautiful, 
        enchanting, magnificent, and fascinating get its true physical meaning.

      <h3>The Emperor of Four</h3>
      <p>
        Situated off the northwest tip of Bird’s Head Peninsula on Papua, the most eastern island of the 
        Indonesian Archipelago, Raja Ampat or literally meaning <b>‘The Four Kings’</b> is an archipelago 
        comprising over 1,500 small islands, cays, and shoals surrounding the four main islands 
        of <b>Waigeo, Batanta, Salawati,</b> and <b>Misool.</b> The name Raja Ampat itself is believed to 
        derive from a legend where a woman found seven eggs, with four of them hatch and become 
        the kings of the four main islands, while the other three became a woman, a ghost, and a stone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="pict/rajaAmpat/1.jpg" width="800" height="534" />
      </p>
      <p>
        For underwater enthusiasts, Raja Ampat definitely offers some of the world’s ultimate experience. 
        The territory within the islands of the Four Kings is enormous, covering 9.8 million acres 
        of land and sea, home to 540 types of corals, more than 1,000 types of coral fish and 700 
        types of mollusks. This makes it the most diverse living library for the world's coral 
        reef and underwater biota.
        <br><br>
        According to a report developed by The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International, 
        around 75% of the world's species live here! Raja Ampat’s sheer numbers and diversity 
        of marine life and its huge pristine coral reef systems are a scuba dream come true – and 
        a fantastic site for snorkelers too.

      </p>
      <p>
        As you embark on your dive here, the phrase "Attention to detail" takes on new meaning as 
        pigmy seahorses swim around your fingers. Manta Rays and wobbegongs will glide right by you. 
        Schools of Tuna fish, giant trevallies, snappers, batfish, and even barracudas are there 
        to complete your underwater "meeting list". Not to mention the friendly assistant of the 
        dugong, and a busy colleague, the turtle. Down at the sea floors, giant sea clams 
        measuring to over one meter in length truly offers one of kind close encounter 
        sensation.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, there are a lot of diving and snorkeling spots to choose from in these vast waters. 
        Among these are at the <b>Kabui Passage</b> (the very narrow passage between Waigeo and Gam Island 
        crossed by the renowned British explorer, Alfred Russell Wallace in 1860), around the 
        <b>Arborek</b> Island’s Dock, <b>Sawandarek, Yenbuba, Friwen Wall,</b> and many-many more.

      </p>
      <p>
        While its underwater splendors are beyond exceptional, the landscape above the surface 
        is equally breathtaking. As if it was carefully designed and placed with such aesthetic, 
        the rock islets amidst the clear blue water and bright blue sky in <b>Piaynemo</b> offers some 
        of the most spectacular sceneries on the face of the earth. Looking down from the top 
        of the hill, it almost seems that Mother Nature painted her finest artwork and offers 
        a glimpse of paradise. Further at Wayag Island, you will also find an amazing rock 
        islets formation in an even bigger scale.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The incredible wildlife of Raja Ampat does not stop underwater. Amidst the many 
        thick jungles within the islands, one can still find various bird species including 
        the spectacular <b>Cendrawasih or the bird of Paradise.</b> There is also an endemic species 
        of cuscus, the <b>Waigeou cuscus</b> or Waigeou spotted cuscus <em>(Spilocuscus papuensis)</em> which 
        is a species of marsupial in the family Phalangeridae.

      <h3>The Local Ambience</h3>
      <p>
        Aside from its endless fascinating natural attractions, Raja Ampat also offers the distinct 
        hospitality of the Papuan. At the Arborek Tourism Village, you can stay at a number of 
        homestays and mingle with the locals whilst observing their daily life and unique traditions. 
        When a group of tourists arrived, they usually perform a traditional welcome dance right at 
        the dock and entertained the ‘guests’ with various Papuan folk songs.
        <br><br>
        With all its spectacular wonders inland, on the shore, and beyond the waters, and distinct 
        serene ambiance that you rarely find anywhere else on earth, Raja Ampat truly offers the 
        ultimate experience ones can only dream of.
        <br><br>
        So, whether you are an avid diver, occasional snorkeler, or just someone who appreciated 
        the beauty in every sense, Raja Ampat welcomes you to the Heaven on Earth.
