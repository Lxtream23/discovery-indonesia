        On the westernmost tip of the Island of Flores sits the town of Labuan Bajo. It lies peacefully, 
        with many wonders waiting for you to explore. Labuan Bajo was only a small fishing site, but 
        flourished to become the gateway to many exotic destinations in East Nusa Tenggara.

      <h3>The Port to Paradise</h3>
      <p>
        The extraordinary interest among travelers lies in Komodo Dragons or locally called ora. It is 
        a valuable alluring factor, showcased in its superb national park.
        <br><br>
        <b>The Komodo National Park</b> was listed as UNESCO’s World Heritage Site in 1991. Both on land and 
        underwater, it is home to fascinating wildlife.  The park consists of Komodo Island, Rinca Island, 
        Padar Island, and numerous smaller islands around.
        <br><br>
        Labuan Bajo is known as the city of sunset. You can find plenty of out-of-this-world scenic views 
        of the spectacular sky.

      </p>
      <p>
        There are some interesting destinations that you can discover inside the city. The Mirror Cave is 
        located only 4 kilometers away from Labuan Bajo. It is said that Dutch archaeologist, Theodor 
        Verhoeven,, who believed Labuan Bajo was once located underwater, founded this cave in 1951. 
        The local name for the cave is Goa Batu Cermin. You can see the reflective stones shine at you 
        in some parts, hence, the name “Goa Batu Cermin.” It translates to “stone mirror cave.”
        <br><br>
        Have you ever swam in a cave-lake before? Here’s a chance to try it in Rangko Cave. Nestled 
        in Ranko Village, this natural wonder presents its blue water and sunlight shining directly 
        towards its cave lake. Their stalagmites will surely amaze you as well.
        <br><br>
        You can also explore the paths to Cunca Rami and Cunca Wulang canyon waterfall!
        <br><br>
        Bukit Cinta, Puncak Amelia, and Puncak Silvia are all vantage points, not far away from 
        Komodo Airport in Labuan Bajo. You can enjoy some spectacular views of the island and 
        the open sea at sunset.

      </p>
      <p>
        You can head to Kampung Ujung and experience the delicious local food center in Labuan 
        Bajo for the culinary feast.
        <br><br>
        Feel the romance with its stunning landscapes. Wooden cottages with thatched roofs are 
        camouflaged by shrubberies and towering trees up in the sloping township. They overlook 
        an idyllic harbor, creating perfect elements of an unforgettable experience.
        <br><br>
        Labuan Bajo can be that ideal getaway with choices of land and sea to explore for some 
        adventurers. Try the liveaboard experience, where you get to live onboard the spectacular 
        phinisi boats for several days, visit gorgeous islands and dive into the stunning wonders 
        of the sea.
        <br><br>
        One of the most famous islands to visit during your liveaboard trip is Padar Island. 
        With its outstanding panorama, Padar Island is swiftly becoming a new favorite place 
        for travelers. It showcases rolling hills and rugged volcanic mountains. With its 
        grassland and trees covering its terrace, Padar Island boasts its striking savanna hill.

      <h3>The City of Sunset</h3>
      <p>
        There are three majorities of ethnic groups, namely the Manggarai, Bima, and Bugis. 
        People coming from other parts of Flores, like Ende, Ngada, Maumere, live side by 
        side with them. You can meet some of the locals in their beautiful village of Labuan Bajo.
        <br><br>
        Welcoming ceremonies and traditional dances will greet you warmly upon your visit to Melo Village.
