      <h2>Jakarta</h2>
      <b>A City that Never Sleeps</b>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Jakarta is the capital city of the Republic of Indonesia. Jakarta is a huge, sprawling 
        metropolis, home to over <b>10 million people</b> with diverse ethnic group backgrounds from 
        all over Indonesia. During the day, the number increases with commuters making their 
        way to work in the city and flock out again in the evenings.
        <br><br>
        Located on the northwest of Java Island, the province of DKI Jakarta has rapidly expanded 
        through the years, absorbing many villages in the process. In fact, Jakarta is a 
        conglomeration of villages known as <em>kampung</em>, now crossed by main roads and superhighways.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h3>The Charm of the Metropolis</h3>
      <p>
        A part of the local experience is that you may drive down one wide avenue one minute, then suddenly 
        find yourself squeezed into a small street together with scores of cars and motorbikes. With 
        its many suburbs, Jakarta has become a Megapolitan city. Therefore, when you visit Jakarta 
        it is best to invest in a good map or rely on GPS to navigate around.
        <br><br>
        Jakarta is not only the seat of the national government and the provincial government, but it 
        is also Indonesia’s political center. Moreover, Jakarta is the hub of Indonesia’s national 
        finance and trade. It is no wonder, that you will find Jakarta as a dynamic city, with 
        activities taking place around-the-clock throughout its populated areas.
        <br><br>
        This city is divided into 5 districts, namely <em>Jakarta Pusat, Jakarta Utara, Jakarta Barat, 
        Jakarta Timur, and Jakarta Selatan</em>. The term <em>‘Jabodetabek’</em> refers to <em>Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-
        Tangerang-Bekasi</em> - the Greater Jakarta area consists of megacities surrounding the capital.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Get Around</h3>
      <p>
        Jakarta Pusat or central Jakarta is where you can find the iconic landmarks such as Monas, The Merdeka 
        Palace, The National Museum, Istiqlal Mosque, The Jakarta Cathedral, and Monumen Selamat 
        Datang or the welcome monument widely renowned as Bunderan HI.
        <br><br>
        Some of the most prestigious shopping malls and upscale hotels are located right in the heart of 
        Central Jakarta. Here you can enjoy the 24 hours excitements of Jakarta!
        <br><br>
        Jakarta Utara or North Jakarta is where Taman Impian Jaya Ancol or Ancol Dreamland is located. 
        It boasts a variety of amusements such as Dufan Theme park, Seaworld, Atlantis Water 
        Adventure Park, Ecopark, an Art market and comfortable accommodation choices with a 
        complete culinary destination.

        From Ancol Bay, you can hop on a boat and head to Jakarta’s pristine getaway, enriched with 
        tropical islands named Kepulauan Seribu, or The Seribu Archipelago and sometimes also 
        simply famous as The Thousand Islands.
        <br><br>
        Here, there are more than 10 islands that one can explore. Some of the most famous are Bidadari, 
        Tidung, Pari and Pulau Macan, the home of private beach huts that lets you plunge directly 
        from your bed to the open sea.
        <br><br>
        Jakarta Barat or West Jakarta, Jakarta Timur or East Jakarta and Jakarta Selatan or South Jakarta 
        are those areas where a cluster of houses are located alongside offices, public facilities 
        and more choices of shopping malls!
        <br><br>
        The amazing historical heritage in West Jakarta is Museum Fatahillah and its surrounding Kota Tua 
        or Old Jakarta district is where you can ride a classic bike to tour the area. The new iconic 
        destination in West Jakarta is the contemporary art exhibition venue named Museum Macan, 
        where Yayoi Kusama’s artworks are displayed.
        <br><br>
        In East Jakarta, you can visit Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, the miniature of Indonesia Archipelago. 
        You can explore the details of traditional houses and a glimpse of Indonesia’s diverse culture 
        in this park.
        <br><br>
        When visiting South Jakarta, make sure to drop by at Setu Babakan and get to know the story of 
        Betawi culture, the native ethnic group of Jakarta. There are a museum and traditional Betawi 
        houses with few activities that you can experience, such as getting to know the traditional 
        dance and music, tasting the local beverage of Bir Pletok, have a bite of Kerak Telor and 
        making small ondel ondel, the iconic figure of Jakarta!
        <br><br>
        All parts of Jakarta are studded with their own culinary icons and trending coffee shops to spend 
        the day at. Here, you can easily find the five national foods, namely Nasi Goreng, Gado-gado, 
        Soto, Sate, and Rendang.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Indonesia’s Independence Day is also celebrated annually on the 17th of August with various 
        activities throughout the nation. Especially in Jakarta, you will find communities decorating 
        their homes with the national color of red and white.
        <br><br>

        race and Panjat Pinang or the Pinang climb are two iconic games that are always crowded 
        with spectators.
      </p>
      <h3>Get There</h3>
      <h4>By Air</h4>
      <p>
        Jakarta has two international airports, one is the larger Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, 
        located in Tangerang, now in the neighboring province of Banten. The other is the smaller 
        Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, which is reserved for limited domestic flights. 
      </p>
      <h4>Overland</h4>
      <p>
        As the nation’s capital, Jakarta is connected by land to major cities in Java, public 
        transport to get to Jakarta is available by bus and train.
        <br><br>
        People who visit Jakarta, usually take time to stop by the neighboring Bogor, famous 
        for it's Botanical Garden and highlands getaway in the Puncak area.
        <br><br>
        Or if you prefer the coastal area, head to Banten and spend a holiday at Anyer and Carita Beach.
      </p>
      <h4>By Sea</h4>
      <p>
        Tanjung Priok is the name of Jakarta’s seaport, located in North Jakarta. It is the busiest 
        seaport in Indonesia.
        <br><br>
        In April 2018, Genting Dream Cruises, based in Singapore, has opened special itineraries 
        to visit Indonesia’s capital for this summer to voyage. A delightful choice for the 
        one who wants to splurge aboard a luxurious cruise ship.
      </p>

      <h3>Get Around</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to travel around Jakarta is by rented car, taxi or package tour. Be 
        prepared though to meet traffic jams, especially when traveling during peak hours 
        and into business districts, including the Old Batavia area. 
        <br><br>
        It is advisable therefore to choose a hotel near the location where you will have 
        your meeting or business appointments or to the attraction or destination you wish 
        to visit. Distances between points of interest in Jakarta can sometimes be far and 
        might be interspersed with traffic.
