        Flanked by the Gaspar and Karimata Strait, off the eastern coast of Sumatra, Belitung 
        is a beautiful island blessed with magnificent landscape, divine beaches, and outstanding 
        scenery. The coast of Tanjung Kelayang, in the northern part of the island, is the heart

        glimpse of what paradise would be like.
        <br><br>
        Once a secluded getaway, Tanjung Kelayang is now evolving into a vast integrated resort 
        following the government’s policy that designated the area as a 324.38 hectare Special 
        Economic Zone (SEZ). Here, pearly white sandy beach, unsullied sea, and nothing but 
        tropical wonder await. Moreover, what makes it truly unique is the formation of the 
        fascinating boulders that beautifully decorate the beach. These huge slabs of granite 
        extend to the sea and they seem to have been strewn here by the hands of mother nature. 
        Some of these boulders formation even resemble animal silhouettes, notably the shape 
        of a swallow or kelayang, hence the name. 
      </p>
