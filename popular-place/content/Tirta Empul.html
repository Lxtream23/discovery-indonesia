      <p>
        One of the busiest water temples in Indonesia, Tirta Empul is a temple considered sacred by Balinese Hindu community. 
        The temple has several holy springs which are said to have been created by The God Indra and believed to be blessed 
        water that could purify those who bathe there. 
        <br><br>
        Tirta Empul is dedicated to Vishnu, the Hindu God of water. In the Balinese language, Tirta Empul loosely translated 
        means water gushing from the earth, which for this reason Tirta Empul is regarded as a holy spring. The Tirta Empul 
        Temple includes shrines to Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, as well as one for Indra and Mount Batur. It is considered one of 
        the five most holy temples in all of Bali and is considered one of the holiest water sources in Bali. You can also 
        find other holy water temples in Bali such as Pura Ulun Danu at Lake Beratan, Pura Tirta Tawar at Gianyar, Pura Tirta 
        Harum at Bangli, Pura Tirta Taman Mumbul at Badung, and many more.

      <p>
        Tirta Empul was founded in 926 A.D and is still being actively used to this day. Although it is a sacred place of worship to 
        the locals, tourists from all over the world are welcome to experience the beauty and participate in the purification rituals. 
        In 2017, the former US President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and daughters Malia and Natasha, made Tirta Empul one of their 
        selected sites to visit and experience.
        <br><br>
        If you’re planning to visit Tirta Empul, here’s what to know more about this sacred temple:
      </p>

      <h3>The inside of Tirta Empul </h3>
      <p>
        The Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple is located in the village of Manukaya, near the town of Tampaksiring, not far from Ubud, in the 
        Gianyar Regency, the cultural heart of Bali. The temple is situated just below the Presidential Palace of Tampaksiring. Built-in 
        1957 by Indonesia's first president, Soekarno, the beautifully built palace itself is an important landmark of the island and the 
        country. Together with the Presidential Palace, the Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple provides some of the most fascinating views you 
        will ever see.
        <br><br>
        As a petirtaan or bathing center, Tirta Empul is quite a large temple complex and it takes at least 30 minutes to an hour to explore 
        the entire site. Just as at other temples and sacred sites around the island, you will need to put on a 'sarong' before entering 
        the premises. The sarongs are available at the temple's entrance and can be rented for a small donation.
        <br><br>
        As soon as you enter the temple, you will walk through the large stone Balinese gate (locally known as candi bentar) and arrive in 
        the outer courtyard of the temple. This area of the temple is called jaba sisi. At the end of the courtyard is another candi bentar 
        built into the wall that leads to the central courtyard. This gate is guarded by smoothly carved huge statues of two Dwarapala or 
        guardians given a brush of golden colors. At the top of the gate is a carving of Kala which is quite different from other Kala carvings 
        elsewhere since it has fangs that stick upwards and a pair of hands with open arms.
      </p>
            
      <p>
        <img src="./pict/Tirta Empul/image2.webp" width="800" height="534" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the inner courtyard, you will arrive at the jaba tengah area which is the main area of the temple. The holy springs here bubble 
        up into a large, crystal-clear pool within the temple and gush out through 30 waterspouts into the two sacred purification pools. Local 
        Balinese and Hindu worshippers stand in long lines in the pools waiting to dip their heads under the waterspouts in a purification ritual 
        known as melukat. Bathers start in the pool on the left side standing in the pool to the waist under the first water spout. Once they have 
        cleansed themselves under the first spout they join the next queue. This process is continued until they have cleansed themselves under 
        each waterspout. However, there are two spouts that are meant only for cleansing the dead and are prohibited to be used by the living for 
        the melukat ritual.
        <br><br>
        Behind the purification, pools are the final section of the Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple, called the jeroan. Mostly overlooked by tourists, 
        the jeroan or inner courtyard is a pleasant place where people come to pray. The front part of the courtyard is dominated by the large water 
        spring that feeds the purification pools. The spring is filled with green algae and small fish swim among the reeds. Behind the springs are 
        large Hindu shrines. This part of the temple is nice to quickly explore. The shrines are brightly decorated, which contrasts with the starched 
        white clothing of the Balinese who come here to pray.
        <br><br>
        As you exit Tirta Empul you pass through a large pool filled with koi fish. This section of the temple is walled off on all four sides from the 
        rest of the complex, which gives it a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Fat koi swim lazily in the pond waiting for their next meal.
      </p> 
      
        <h3>The Legend of Creation</h3>
        <p>
          Based on a manuscript called Usana Bali, the creation of Tirta Empul involves the myth of an epic battle between a powerful yet wicked king named 
          Mayadenawa and a God, Bhatara Indra. The king did not believe in God, and forbade his subject from worshipping God. He was also dangerous. He possessed 
          a spiritual power but was too drunk with his power and carelessly used it for black magic. Seeing the chaos, a priest named Sang Kulputih prayed to Bhatara 
          Indra to put an end to the evil king.
        </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./pict/Tirta Empul/image3.webp" width="800" height="534" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Bhatara Indra and his warriors came to attack Mayadenawa and dethroned him. Mayadenawa and his troops fled to the north of a village which is now known 
        as ‘Tampak Siring’. At night, when Bhatara Indra’s army were deep asleep, Mayadenawa snuck into their camp and created a beautiful but poisonous spring that 
        the army would drink from upon waking up. When Mayadenawa crept into the camp, he walked on the sides of his feet so as not to leave footprints--this is believed 
        to be the origin of the village’s name, 'Tampak Siring', which translates as 'tilted footprint'.
        <br><br>
        In the morning, Bhatara Indra awoke to find his men were poisoned to death. It was then, through his power as a God that he pierced the ground with his staff, 
        creating a sacred healing spring of holy water. The water was sprayed onto the dead army and they came back to life. This water source which is believed to have 
        healing properties and a source of life came to be known as Tirta Empul.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing that his plan had failed, Mayadenawa tried to transform himself into all sorts of different beings but to no avail, since Bhatara Indra continued to chase him. 
        When at last he transformed himself into a boulder, Indra shot an arrow through it, and eventually killed the evil king. The blood of Mayadenawa that gushed from the 
        boulder is believed to have formed the Petanu River, and for over a thousand years, the river was cursed making rice grow rapidly, but having an awful reek of blood. 
        The Balinese Hindu people commemorate the death of Mayadenawa every 210 days in the Balinese traditional calendar as the day when Virtue triumphs over Evil in the 
        ritual and ceremony called Galungan.
